Once upon a time, in the quaint village of Algorithmia, there lived a clever mathematician named Alice.
Alice had an unusual way of solving mathematical problems that puzzled her fellow villagers.
She had mastered the art of puzzle solving using mathematics

One sunny morning, Alice received a mysterious letter from the village elder.
The letter contained a series of numbers and operators, like a secret code.
The elder, known for his love of riddles, had sent this as a challenge to Alice.

The letter read:

```
5 3 2 * 8 2 / - +
```

Alice knew that this was no ordinary puzzle. To solve it, she had to evaluate the expression to find the hidden message.
The numbers and operators seemed like an enigma, but Alice was up for the challenge.
She decided to use her knowledge to decipher the message.

Can you help out Alice in deciphering the puzzle
