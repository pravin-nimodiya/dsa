A group of people goes for an expedition by boat.
As your boats approach land, the people begin taking inventory (food) from supplies.

They write down the number of Calories contained by the various meals, snacks, rations, etc.
that they've brought with them, one item per line.
Each person separates their own inventory from the previous person's inventory (if any) by a blank line.

For example, suppose the persons finish writing their items' Calories and end up with the following list:

1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000

This list represents the Calories of the food carried by five person:

In case any person gets hungry and need extra snacks,
they need to know which person to ask:
they'd like to know how many Calories are being carried by the person carrying the most Calories.

How many total Calories is the person with max calories carrying?
