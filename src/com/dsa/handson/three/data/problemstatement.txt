The Mysterious Library Catalog

In the heart of the quiet town of Booksville, there stood a magnificent library known as the Book Haven.
The library contained an extensive collection of books, each bearing a unique International Standard Book Number (ISBN)
that identified it uniquely. The librarian, Mr. Jenkins, was known for his meticulous cataloging skills.

One sunny morning, Mr. Jenkins faced a puzzling challenge. He had received a trove of new books,
and it was his responsibility to catalog them in a way that allowed quick and sorted access based on ISBN.
The challenge was that the town council insisted on keeping the books sorted in ascending order of their ISBN
at all times.

Here is the problem Mr. Jenkins faced:

**Problem:** Design a library catalog system for Mr. Jenkins to store books based on their ISBN.
The system should support the following operations:

1. `addBook(isbn, title)`: Adds a new book to the catalog with the given ISBN and title.

2. `deleteBook(isbn)`: Deletes a book from the catalog based on its ISBN.

3. `findBookByISBN(isbn)`: Retrieves the title of a book based on its ISBN.

4. `displayCatalog()`: Displays the entire library catalog, sorted by ISBN, to assist Mr. Jenkins in keeping the library
 in perfect order.

As Mr. Jenkins, you need to implement this library catalog system. Your solution should ensure that the books are always
sorted by their ISBN, meeting the town council's requirements for the Book Haven.

Help Mr. Jenkins create the ideal library catalog system to keep the books of Booksville neatly organized!
